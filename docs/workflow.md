# Workflow

We used Webscraper to scrape data from [WarsawUprisng.com](warsawuprising.com/witnesses). We chose this tool because it is the most efficient way to collect information from the website.

The data scraped from the website was plugged into Orange 3. We chose Orange3 because we felt comfortable with the program and after experimenting with it, we were confident that results could be achieved.

From Orange 3, we used the widgets corpus, preprocess text, topic modeling, distances, hierarchical clustering, and word cloud.
