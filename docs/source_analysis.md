# Source Analysis

We initially searched for any scholarly website that contain the necessary data for the historical event of Warsaw 

Uprising. After checking several websites and searches, we concluded the best website that other sources utilize for research 

is warsawuprising.com. The website is a collection of information about the Warsaw Uprising. On the front page of the website 

shows there are links to FAQ, timeline, witnesses, photos, movies, songs, and other resources. The resources are linked to 

related articles, books, and other written material that is used to tell the story about the Warsaw Uprising. The organization 

that maintains the website is called “Project InPosterum”.

Since our project thesis centers around the witnesses, we decided to focus on the witnesses page of the website.
