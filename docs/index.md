Our group’s research topic is the Warsaw Uprising (Polish: Powstanie Warszawskie) that occurred during World War II. The 

Uprising began on 1 August 1944 and ended on 2 October 1944 furthermore, it was a major part of a nationwide operation 

referred to as "Operation Tempest", launched at the time of the Soviet Lublin–Brest Offensive. The main Polish objectives were 

to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the Allies defeat Germany. The Uprising was expected to last about a week and 

was seen largely as a “mopping-up” operation; however, it turned out to be a miscalculation. The Germans decided to make a 

stand and defend “fortress” Warsaw as the Soviets halted their offensive. The uprising lasted not one but nine weeks, turning 

into the longest and bloodiest urban insurgency of the Second World War.
