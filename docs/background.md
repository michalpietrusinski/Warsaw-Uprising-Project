The main idea of the Project Warsaw Uprising is to present and analyze the differences between the witness accounts from the period of the 63 days of the heroic fighting of 1944. The analysis of the Polish Home Army – AK (Armia Krajowa), the German soldiers SS (Schutzstaffel) and the Russian Army soldiers peacefully waiting on the other side of the Vistula river. Furthermore, the timeline of the major battles / skirmishes of the Uprising located in the various neighborhoods of the Warsaw.

## Historical Background



It is beyond uncertainty that the Warsaw Uprising which took place 70 years ago in 1944 is one of the most significant, heroic and tragic events in the 20th century of Polish history. During 63 days of patriotic uprising many thousands of predominantly young Poles were killed in an imbalanced battle with the German occupiers. This investigation will focus on the areal support for the Home Army (AK) during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. This project will discuss the causes and consequences of the action taken by the authority of Great Britain, United States of America and Soviet Union as well as the Polish government in exile regarding the Warsaw Uprising.
Sources to be evaluated include inter alia Rising ’44: The battle for Warsaw written by British historian Norman Davies which arouses controversy Najnowsza Historia Polityczna Polski: Okres 1939-1945 [Modern Political History of Poland: Period 1939-1945] written by witness of those times, officer of Polish Army, historian Wladyslaw Pobog-Malinowski. Analysis of those should indicate who is responsible for the failure of air support throughout Warsaw Uprising. The role of GPS readings is to allow us to question reliability of collected material and evidence, assess and judge with what degree of certainty can we asses who was responsible limited and insufficient air support for the Home Army (AK) during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944?

During the Conference of the Big Three in Teheran in 1943 the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Prime Minister of Great Britain Winston Churchill, and the Premier of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin decided on Polish issues. In the agreement it had been decided to leave Poland in the zone of Soviet influence. Nonetheless, Churchill reminded Stalin of the fact that Britain declared war on Germany because of the invasion of Poland, and thus Britain was obliged to restore “Strong and Independent Poland as the essential instrument in the European orchestra” (Ciechanowski, 142).
The outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising on 1st August 1944 initiated the intensive diplomatic activities of the Polish government in exile, which had hopes for support to the Uprising forces mainly from Britain, which became the confidant of the Polish Affair in relations with the United States.

The President of the Polish Republic Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz, in his official note to the Prime Minister of Great Britain: “Warsaw Fights” (Davies, 356), wrote: “I appeal to your friendship to Poland and deep understanding of soldierly solidarity” (Davies, 356). In his response the Prime Minister of Great Britain ordered the “airdrop operation in the feasibility conditions” (Pobog-Malinowski, 285). In response, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Alan Brooke appointed the date of the first airdrop to be conducted from the Polish Transfer Base in Brindisi, Italy, from 4th to 5th August. Then, he reversed his decision because of “the reluctance to send the Allied planes on such a distant flight route” (Telegram).
Winston Churchill suggested a shuttle operation and requested landing facilities for the RAF at the Soviet airfields, but Stalin refused (Zamoyski, 366). The Soviet standpoint was: “The Soviet Government wishes itself not to be – either directly or indirectly – linked to the row in Warsaw” (Official statement).The Commander of the Armia Krajowa General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski when directing his everyday communication with London on 6th August stated that due to insufficient support: “Some charges are levelled (...) that Poland has been betrayed by England” (Pobog-Malinowski, 283).The wordings entailed reactions of the British authorities, which resulted in Field Marshal Alan Brooke’s order to carry out an airdrop on 8th August.
Following the further diplomatic insistence of the Polish government in exile, Winston Churchill issued the order on 13th August to intensify airdrops disregarding any adversities.

On 18th August the Polish ministers, Antoni Pajdak and Stanislaw Jasiukowicz, cabled the Polish Prime Minister Stanislaw Mikolajczyk: “Disproportion between London’s promises of support and actual minor airdrops (...) evoke some hostile feelings among people addressed to Allies and the government” (283).On 20th August, Winston Churchill urged Franklin D. Roosevelt to write a common note to Josef Stalin in support of the Uprising forces:“Let us consider what the public opinion of the world will be if the antifascists in Warsaw have been left alone” (Davies, 414-415).
In reply to the above, during the final phase of the Warsaw uprising from 13 September to 1 October Soviet aircraft were engaged in helping Warsaw insurgents. “Soviets conduct airdrops without parachutes thereby significant amount of equipment that reached the insurgents was seriously damaged” (Warsaw Uprising Museum).

On 18th September operation Frantic 7 was conducted under the command of Colonel Karl Truesdell. “Bombers from 3rd Bombers Division of 8th US Army Air Force took off at 6.20 from the airfields in Eastern Englan” (Pawlak, 147) and “with one intermediatelanding in the Soviet Union, which was for the first time allowed by Stalin, flew to the airspace of Warsaw – once only, but in spectacular volumes: 107 B-17 “Flying Fortress” bombers, 1,100 pilots, 100 tons of load in drop containers” (Warsaw Uprising Museum). However, “only 228 out of 1284 containers goes into the Polish hands” (Pobog-Malinowski, 287) the rest was dropped on the area controlled by Nazi Germany. “Beginning from 4th August to 21 September, planes from the base in Brindisi took off 196 times in airdrop sorties with Polish, British, Canadian, South African, and New Zealand crews” (Davies, Foreword). They flew to support war-torn Warsaw.

The story presented in a previous paragraphs about the events directly connected to areal support for fighting Warsaw is coherent and supported by many sources and evidences. However to what extent can we claim that presented facts represent the progression of historical events in a truly adequate manner?

American historian William H. McNeill would argue that every attempt of writing the history carries huge burden of subjectivity and there is nothing wrong about it – its essential part of writing about history. Historians not only represent the past events but also shape the minds of future generations thus they have a right to represent that events to some extent in a subjective way. In his opinion being historian is an art of putting together the disassembled pieces of past events in a coherent continuum. The need to use their creativity in order to recreate the past. Thomas Negel claims thet even if we try to be objective our work is still affected by subjectivity and there is no way to be fully objective. Bised on his work we may deduce that we will never know the entirely objective picture of that what happened in the past.

It is beyond doubt that the conference of the Big Three in Tehran changed the geopolitical face of European Continent. The political compromise between Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin put Poland and its authority in a disadvantageous situation. Its main ally – Great Britain – became an ally of the direct enemy of Poland – the Soviet Union. Moreover, Stalin enforced the transfer of Poland into his zone of influence. This fact complicated the Polish-British relationship and limited significantly the possibility of providing assistance to Poland by Great Britain because all decisions of the British Government, related to Poland, had to be taken in consultation with Stalin.
The outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising stimulated the Polish diplomatic service in exile. It appears from the evidence obtained and quoted in this project from Wladyslaw Pobog-Malinowski that the appeals of Polish politicians did not translate into real help for the AK in Warsaw. He states that the efforts of the Polish diplomatic service – the Polish Ambassador in London Raczyński dated 2nd August, the Staff of the Supreme Commander dated 3rd August and the President of the Republic of Poland Raczkiewicz dated 7th August – “actually gave nothing”. He adds: “the outcome of the preliminary efforts cannot be considered even as miserable”. He remarks that the efforts were made with “restrained frequency” (283).
In his view, the “Englishmen cared for the sake of appearance, displayed good will but in fact, however, held the understanding tethered to cold sense, committing sin against the most faithful ally” (284) by providing insufficient support for insurgents in Warsaw.
Simultaneously, he emphasizes the importance of the return to London of the Commander-in Chief, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, whose diplomatic efforts to support Warsaw he identifies as: “constant, categorical, tenacious” (285). A rally initiated by General Sosnkowski, which took place on 12 August in the Hall of Westminster Cathedral, where he voiced the words addressed to “the opinion of the whole world, not to let the extermination of Warsaw and its over one million population” (Dziennik Polski). Pobog-Malinowski relates this to the decision of Marshal Slessor on six night air raids over Warsaw from 12th to 17th August, involving 98 airplanes.

Norman Davies in Rising '44 opposes Władysław Pobog-Malinowski’s judgement, referring to the results of the Polish diplomatic service in the context of aid for the Fighters of Warsaw Uprising. He stresses that as a result of President Raczkiewicz’s actions, “Winston Churchill responded with all power (...) that despite some reluctance among the government functionaries he expressed his acceptance to start promptly the preparations for RAF’s sorties over Warsaw” (Davies, 361).
He also remarks that in response to Polish appeals for support “on 4th August, Churchill cabled Stalin informing him on planned airdrops of sixty tons of equipment and ammunition following the strenuous request of the underground army” (361). The cable is the evidence of the effective methods of Polish diplomacy and British fidelity towards Poland. It text opposes Pobog-Malinowski’s allegations of passivity of Great Britain towards Poland and ineffective actions of the Polish diplomats and the military. Historical investigation carried out in the light of the quoted evidence, taken from two opposing titles the Najnowsza Historia Polityczna Polski and the Rising '44 by reveals completely different assessments of the efficiency of the Polish diplomatic and military services in the face of outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. It displays the polyphony of the historians voices and the interpretation of history. Nevertheless, they both agree that the Soviet Union made all necessary steps in order to frustrate British and American attempts to successfully support AK. And that Soviet support in the final part of the Warsaw Uprising was rather propagandistic than actual.

The AK and the Polish government in exile constantly appealed to the British government for support. The United States Government acted in concert with the British Government. Soviets airdrop operation was ineffective and started at very late part of the uprising. Because of the Teheran conference and transfer of Poland into Soviet zone of influence western government had hands tied. Stalin refutation for landing facilities for the RAF at the Soviet airfields made already then very dangerous airdrop operation even more hazardous and logistically difficult. Presented analysis demonstrates that Soviet’s refutation of landing facilities for the RAF entailed the consequences which eventually implies significantly limitations in areal support for the AK in Warsaw.

After 70 years archives of the United Kingdom are still not entirely open for historical research not to mention the Russian archives with the Soviet documentations. We still do not have a access to all the historical sources besides that remembering Thomas Nagel’s ideas we have to account for the subjectivity of all the historians including also subjectivity of this particular paper. That is why our certainty in the judgment is significantly limited.

Nevertheless, judged by collected evidence and taking everything into consideration it can be stated that, Soviet’s airdrops were very ineffective. The Polish government in exile tried to influence the areal support from the Western Allies and both British and the United States government within the limits of their possibilities wanted to support the AK. Nevertheless because of British and American necessity to closely cooperate with the Soviet Union and its refutation of the request about landing facilities for the RAF at the Soviet airfields areal help from the Western Allies was dangerous, logistically difficult, limited and ultimately insufficient.

Therefore based the judgment on the evidences presented the answer to the research question is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was responsible for the limited areal support for the AK during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.
